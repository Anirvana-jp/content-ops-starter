He earned his M.E. degree in 2018 and his Ph.D. in 2021 from the Disaster Prevention Research Institute at Kyoto University in Japan. He has developed Uncertainty Projected Mapping (UPM), a Bayesian-based spatial interpolation method for quantifying uncertainty in earthquake site-response maps. His research interests include studying the response to ambient noise in mountains in search of topographical signatures.\n",
