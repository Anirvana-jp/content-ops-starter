Recently, the Japanese government (MEXT) has announced the next edition of its scholarship programs. Ten years ago, I arrived in Japan in April 2015 with one of these scholarships: the MEXT Scholarship for Research Students. After one year as a research student (2015-2016), I continued with the Master's (2016-2018) and PhD (2018-2021) courses at Kyoto University using this scholarship. In total, I received the MEXT scholarship for six years. After finishing my PhD in 2021, I have been working as an associate faculty member at Hosei University in Tokyo. 

Every year, many MEXT aspirants contact me and ask for guidance on how to prepare for the MEXT Scholarship application. I have always tried to respond to those individual queries in the best possible manner. However, it would be easier if I had jotted down my suggestions in an article that I could readily refer to. Finally, this year, on my 10th anniversary in Japan, as MEXT aspirants started reaching out to me for suggestions, I decided to prepare that article. This article combines my personal experience with that of many MEXT aspirants and scholars I have interacted with over the past decade.  

The MEXT Scholarship for Research Students is a stepping stone for students interested in pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree at a Japanese University. The application process is a year-long, multi-step process (see image below). The exact dates may vary from country to country.  The application process includes the three main steps: (a) submission of application, (b) a written examination and interview, and (c) submission of placement preference (meaning the names of potential advisors and universities). After each step, a screening is done, and finally, only a handful of applicants are selected for the scholarship.

<div style="text-align: center">![](/images/Table.jpg)*The above image is based on the 2025 announcement of the scholarship program by the* [*Embassy of Japan in the Netherlands.*](https://www.nl.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/c_mextrs.html)</div>

<div style="text-align: center"></div>

My advice for surviving this year-long, multi-step application process can be summarized in five key points. 

**Disclaimer:** Before you read my advice, please keep in mind that there are based on the past application process. The application process for this year may have some changes introduced.

### 0. Maintain a good academic record

<div style="text-align: left">My zeroth advice is to maintain a good academic record in high school and at the undergraduate level. I list this as the first piece of advice because this is a prerequisite. You cannot change it days or months before you apply, but you can prepare yourself in the long term. Japan loves perfection, and you having a good academic record is a reflection of that perceived perfection. **A good academic record will ensure a smooth sailing through the preliminary screening process that follows the submission of your documents**. The better academic record you have, the better your chances will be.</div>

### 1. Be able to answer “Why Japan?”

The purpose of the MEXT scholarship is to train international scholars in Japanese expertise, enabling them to contribute to the development of their home countries. Please note that there is no obligation to return to the home country after graduation. So, a MEXT aspirant should have a clear logical answer to the question, “Why Japan?”. This question will come up repeatedly in the application process. You will need to answer it in the HR and technical interview rounds. You should also clearly address it in your research plan. If your proposed research is (a) relevant for your “home country”, and (b) your work with “Japanese experts” could train you and help contribute to your “home country”, it will be easier for you to explain your reason for coming to Japan. \*\*A clear and logical reason for coming to Japan will increase your chances of sailing through the first screening process. \*\*

### 2. Be respectful of your “home country” and “Japan”

In the HR and technical interview rounds, you will speak with representatives from the Japanese embassy in your country and technical experts from your home country. So, although the goal is to explain why you want to come to Japan, please do not speak badly about your home country. You can be respectful to both and still make it clear that you need to come to Japan. **A respectful mentality and a logical reason for coming to Japan will increase your chances of passing the first screening process.** 

**Note:** I have intentionally skipped writing much on the written examination part of the application process. It is mainly an English aptitude test, except for students planning to pursue postgraduate studies in Japanese.

### 3. Begin outlining your research plan early 

An important document to submit as part of your application is a plan for the research you wish to conduct in Japan. This research plan requires time and effort to prepare. My advice is to start outlining a basic research plan as soon as possible and then gradually develop it into a detailed plan. As you work on it, here are some points you should keep in mind:  

*   It's okay not to know exactly what you want to study in Japan. However, if you have an interest in a research topic, make it a starting point and then build on it. 

*   Please ensure that the final version of the research plan can answer the question, “Why Japan?”.  

*   If you have a list of preferred universities in Japan, visit the relevant department's website to see what the latest research trends are. Is there a Professor who is working on a topic that is close to your interest? If so, start checking the professor’s latest publications. Many Japanese Professors do not update their websites regularly, especially the English versions. So, Google their names and see if you can find the latest works.  

*   If you have a preferred professor with whom you want to work, chances are you are already well aware of their research.  

*   Once you find Professors working in areas close to your research interest, start outlining a basic research plan aligned with their latest work. However, you will need to think about how to make an additional contribution to the work. This additional contribution will be the highlight of your proposed research plan. The more clearly you can point out this additional contribution, the easier it will be for you to find an advisor who is ready to host you in Japan.     

*   Once you have a basic research plan ready, please start contacting potential advisors. This is an important point, so I have discussed it separately in the next piece of advice. 

*   If you’re lucky and get a response from a potential advisor early, you can get their feedback on the basic research plan and start working on the final version.
    If you do not get a response from a potential advisor, keep your final version of the research plan a little open-ended, so that when MEXT reaches out to your choice of advisors from the final placement preference, everyone can consider it. A very specific research proposal prepared without feedback from a potential advisor could render it unconsiderable to Professors with slightly different research interests. 

*   Please remember that the final version of your research plan should highlight how your proposal can add new understanding and contribute to your “home country” and how “Japanese expertise” could help you.   

### 4. Contact potential Advisor(s) early

My last advice is the most important. Once you have a basic research plan ready, start reaching out to Professors with whom you want to work in Japan. Please do not wait until you clear the written examination and interview. You should begin even before submitting the application documents. Why? Because many MEXT aspirants reach out to Professors and discuss the possibility of a Master’s or PhD, many months before the application. Suppose your preferred Professor is in demand, or you’re thinking of applying to a top university in Japan. In that case, there is a high chance that the lab’s intake capacity might reach the maximum very early. 

So, as soon as you have a basic research plan ready, write a simple email mentioning these three points: 

1.  Why would you like to work under their guidance? For example, you can mention a particular research paper that caught your attention; this will help them understand that you looked into their work. 

2.  What is your proposed research plan? E.g., you can share the basic research plan in the form of a flowchart or a few key points. 

3.  You plan to apply for the MEXT scholarship. This information reduces the burden on the Professor to look for financial assistance. 

Please don't send a generic email. A simple, clear email goes a long way. You can attach a CV, but avoid attaching a huge file. Instead, send it as a link. 

When you submit the final placement preference in late September, you have the option to submit more than one choice. So, it's better to have a second choice for an advisor. This is because if, for any unforeseen reason, the first choice doesn’t work out, you can always fall back on the second choice. However, it is easier said than done. If you get replies from more than one Professor, you’re lucky. However, there is nothing to worry about if you don’t.

\*\*Some additional points for consideration regarding Japanese language requirements: \*\*

1.  Please clarify your potential advisor's expectations, especially regarding your expertise in the Japanese language. Many labs in Japan have an entirely Japanese environment. Adjusting quickly to these environments is not easy, but many students manage to adapt to them. It's always better to be mentally prepared, so make things clear from the start. 

2.  If you plan to job hunt in Japan after graduation, please understand that most jobs require a certain level of Japanese proficiency. So, although you can get a MEXT scholarship without any Japanese proficiency, you will need to study and prepare yourself if you want to find a job in Japan. 

I wish all MEXT aspirants the best of luck with their applications. Or as they say in Japan, がんばってください。
