Recently, the Japanese government (MEXT) has announced the next edition of its scholarship programs. Ten years ago, I arrived in Japan in April 2015 with one of these scholarships: the MEXT Scholarship for Research Students. After one year as a research student (2015-2016), I continued with the Master's (2016-2018) and PhD (2018-2021) courses at Kyoto University using this scholarship. In total, I received the MEXT scholarship for six years. After finishing my PhD in 2021, I have been working as an associate faculty member at Hosei University in Tokyo. 

Every year, many MEXT aspirants contact me and ask for guidance on how to prepare for the MEXT Scholarship application. I have always tried to respond to those individual queries in the best possible manner. However, it would be easier if I had jotted down my suggestions in an article that I could readily refer to. Finally, this year, on my 10th anniversary in Japan, as MEXT aspirants started reaching out to me for suggestions, I decided to prepare that article. This article combines my personal experience with that of many MEXT aspirants and scholars I have interacted with over the past decade.  

<div style="text-align: center">The MEXT Scholarship for Research Students is a stepping stone for students interested in pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree at a Japanese University. The application is a year-long, multi-step process as shown in the image below. ![](/images/Table.jpg)![](/images/5_2.jpg)</div>
