    subtitle: EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
    text: >
      I am Anirban Chakraborty, an earthquake engineer based in Japan. I earned
      a Ph.D. in 2021 from the Disaster Prevention Research Institute at Kyoto
      University in Japan.


      I developed Uncertainty Projected Mapping (UPM), a Bayesian-based mapping
      for quantifying uncertainty in earthquake site-response maps.


      I also study the seismic response of mountains to ambient noise in search
      of topographical signatures.

    subtitle: DISASTER RESPONSE VOLUNTEER / DAMAGE INVESTIGATOR
    text: >
      I worked as a disaster response volunteer after the 2016 Kumamoto
      Earthquake and the 2018 Japan floods, which allowed me to see the
      disastrous impact of disasters from up close. Later, these volunteer
      experiences led to my joining the JSCE Earthquake Damage Investigation
      Sub-committee. As a damage investigator, I surveyed the 2021 Fukushima
      Earthquake and the 2024 Noto Earthquake.
