    subtitle: EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
    text: >
      I am Anirban Chakraborty, a researcher specializing in earthquake
      engineering. I am currently working as an associate faculty at Hosei
      University in Japan. I earned an M.E. degree in 2018 and a Ph.D. in 2021
      from the Disaster Prevention Research Institute at Kyoto University in
      Japan. I developed Uncertainty Projected Mapping (UPM), a Bayesian-based
      spatial interpolation method for quantifying uncertainty in earthquake
      site-response maps. I also study the seismic response of mountains to
      ambient noise in search of topographical signatures.

      During his time in Japan, the island country has experienced many
      earthquakes. Anirban had seen firsthand the unimaginable damage caused by
      earthquakes on many occasions, including the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes,
      the 2018 Osaka Earthquake, the 2021 Fukushima Earthquake, and the 2024
      Noto Earthquake.
